## About Me ##
I'm 27 years old from Miami, FL. I work for the City of Coral Gables, FL -- just outside of Miami -- as a Digital Media Coordinator. In my spare time, I like to workout, play golf and pickleball, cook at home, and spend time with my wife and family and friends.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I've reverse engineered a little bit of HTML in the past for the backend of the city website, but otherwise I have ZERO coding experience -- other than the couple of hours of fumbling around Git/Github/VSCode...
## Career Goals ##
1. In the short term: find a new job, preferably in the public sector at the federal level, in digital marketing/communications.
2. Medium term: Leverage that experience -- perhaps with an MBA -- to pivot out to tech and spearhead their business-to-government marketing efforts.
3. Long term: Be successful enough to retire slightly early -- around 60-62 -- and work my dream job as a starter/ranger on a golf course.
